# Minimal.db

With the LambdaMOO server comes a tiny database called *minimal.db*. It is just enough to boot-strap a new core. On closer inspection, it also becomes clear that the initial structure doesn't match LambdaCore as their Wizard is actually object #2 and not #3.

Let's take a crack at it anyways, and see where it might lead. The remainder of the document expects you to setup your own LambdaMOO server using the minimal.db as a starting point.
