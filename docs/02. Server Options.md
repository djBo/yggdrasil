## Server Options

The LambdaMOO Programmer Manual goes into great detail explaining how the database itself is involved in providing custom behavior and options. Our goal should at least include adding these overrides as per the docs. This should result in a database that conforms to the given standard.

This also allows us to delve a little deeper into the MOO language, since we'll be creating our first properties.

***The Object***  
Let's start by creating and naming the object itself. This will become object #4.
```
;create(#1, #2)
;#4.name = "Server Options"
```

With the object created, we can assign it as the value to #0.server_options. We can also add the only other property directly accessed by the server:
```
;add_property(#0, "server_options", #4, {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#0, "dump_interval", 3600, {#2, "rc"})
```

***The Properties***  
We can now continue and add all the properties mentioned in the Programmer Manual, and assign the default values as found in the source code and manual:

```
;add_property(#4, "bg_seconds", 3, {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "bg_ticks", 15000, {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "connect_timeout", 300, {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "default_flush_command", ".flush", {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "fg_seconds", 5, {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "fg_ticks", 30000, {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "max_concat_catchable", "", {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "max_list_concat", 4194302, {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "max_stack_depth", 50, {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "max_string_concat", 33554423, {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "name_lookup_timeout", 5, {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "outbound_connect_timeout", 5, {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "boot_msg", "*** Disconnected ***", {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "connect_msg", "*** Connected ***", {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "create_msg", "*** Created ***", {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "recycle_msg", "*** Recycled ***", {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "redirect_from_msg", "*** Redirecting connection to new port ***", {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "redirect_to_msg", "*** Redirecting old connection to this port ***", {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "server_full_msg", {"*** Sorry, but the server cannot accept any more connections right now.", "*** Please try again later."}, {#2, "rc"})
;add_property(#4, "timeout_msg", "*** Timed-out waiting for login. ***", {#2, "rc"})
```

Note that `max_concat_catchable` is the oddball here. From `options.h`:

> If defined, causes an E_QUOTA error to be raised when an overly-large value is spotted.  Otherwise, the task is aborted as if it ran out of seconds, which was the original behavior in this situation.

Also note that `max_concat_catchable`, `max_list_concat` and `max_string_concat` only function on newer LambdaMOO servers.

With these properties defined, we have database driven control on all the possible server options and can continue onwards in our journey of the minimal.
